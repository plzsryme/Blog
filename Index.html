                <h2 class="h2">Volcanoes also built the Cascade Mountains. The Sierra Nevada range and the ridges of the Great Basin were formed by a strained portion of the earth’s crust. <br/>At the border of the Pacific Ocean lie the Coast Ranges. They are relatively low mountains, because they are in the region where occasional earthquakes from time to time build new mountains.</h2>

                The current shape of the North American continent (the present-day territory of the United States of America and Canada) was formed 25,000 years ago. At that time the great northern icecap flowed over the North American continent. This ice flow determined the size and drainage of the Great Lakes. They changed the direction of the Missouri River and carved the channel of the Hudson River.

                On the Atlantic shore of the United States, much of the northern coast is rocky. But the middle and southern Atlantic coasts rise gently from the sea. The Appalachians, which run almost parallel to the east coast, are old mountains with many coal rich valleys between them To the west of the Appalachians
